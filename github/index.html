      <google-codelab-step label="Configuration / Installation" duration="4">
        <p><strong>Step 0</strong> - Installation file preparation</p>
<p>Download the file PortableGit-2.16.2-64-bit.7z.exe</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.16.2.windows.1/PortableGit-2.16.2-64-bit.7z.exe" target="_blank">https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.16.2.windows.1/PortableGit-2.16.2-64-bit.7z.exe</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Installing Git</p>
<p>Run the installation file from Step 0</p>
<p>Do choose to install Git at the folder created for Android IDE installation. For example, D:\Android\PortableGit</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Setting up Git in Android Studio</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> page. It can be accessed from the main starting screen shown below</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, the <strong>Settings</strong> page can be accessed from here</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Enter the path to the <strong>git.exe</strong> from the Git installation at Step 1</li>
</ol>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Test</strong> button will result in this:</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Next, do enter the Github account credentials in the Github entry</li>
</ol>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Test</strong> button will result in this:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Importing an Android Project into GitHub" duration="5">
        <p><strong>Importing into Github (initial commit)</strong></p>
<p>This is to set up a project in your repository at Github.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a new Android project in Android Studio or open a project you like to share to Github</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - At the VCS menu, choose Import into Version Control -&gt; Share Project on Github</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Project creation and upload @ Github</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>With the Github settings done prior to this, you would be seeing the below window</li>
</ol>
<p>You can leave the remote name as the default value. As for the description, do input something useful and descriptive of your project. This could be your portfolio :)</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>The following window will pop up, showing the files going to be committed to the repository</li>
</ol>
<p>The commit message is supposed to capture the changes done for every commit. Do note that <em>commit</em> is not referring to &#34;save&#34; in your Android Studio. The <em>commit</em> is akin to the closing of sales of a day or whenever there&#39;s something major.</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>You can just click &#34;no&#34; for this pop up window. Basically, we would want to commit only essential files, transient files are not required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Transient files here are referring to files that are generated by the IDE pertaining to user specific settings, definitely not critical to the project.</p>
<p>Note: To know which are not required to be committed into a repository, you can refer to this template<a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore" target="_blank">https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore</a></p>
<p>You can also copy its content into .gitignore of your project to automate file exclusion</p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>Upon completion, you&#39;ll see this pop up box on the lower right.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Go to<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">http://github.com</a> with your account logged on, you&#39;ll see the repository is created and the files are committed in it.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Commit changes to the repository" duration="5">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Code changes</li>
</ol>
<p>As you make changes to the project on the Android Studio, the IDE is keeping track of what you have written. The changes will be saved in your local storage as you continue on your development.</p>
<p>Only when you are ready to <em>commit</em>, you <em>push</em> the changes into the repository.</p>
<p>The following screen will appear. It&#39;s a necessary practice to summarize the code being committed. The idea is to capture the essence of what is being committed into the repository.</p>
<p>Notice that vcs.xml is unchecked since the file is not required to be committed.</p>
<p>To effect the changes to the remote repository (in this case, Github itself), you need to push the changes over.</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>File adding/removal</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you add a new file, Android Studio will prompt if you want to add to Git.</p>
<p>*Note: At this point, it is marked to be added to the repository. However, the real adding is only when you commit into the repository.</p>
<p>To commit the new file, choose commit changes from the VCS menu. The screen below will appear and do provide the summary for the commit as well.</p>
<p>After which, you need to push the changes over to Github</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Commit vs push</li>
</ol>
<p>As you continue to code, you need to make sure the changes persists. What we do is to save the changes. When the code are saved, it resides in the storage, eg. in harddisk.</p>
<p>For Git, one should commit when a milestone is reached. Along with it, a summary of changes and progress should be provided. This is to track the changes and to allow roll back, if necessary. However, at this point, the progress is not sync to the Github repository yet.</p>
<p>To sync it, one needs to push to the Github. Push should be done only when you want to sync to the Github or need the changes to be reflected to the rest of the collaborators.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Update changes from the repository" duration="5">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>To update changes to the code from the repository, you can choose update from the CVS menu</li>
</ol>
<p>This is useful if you happen to use 2 different laptops to develop a project. Or the project is jointly developed by multiple authors.</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Due to the projects can be located in a distributed manner, a Github project can be cloned to many different locations or by different collaborators. As the different local repo can be accessed and modified independent of one another some concurrency issue might be raised.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#39;s a possibility that there will be a conflict during update or commit.  A conflict is due to changes made to the repository from the last time your copy of the project was updated.</p>
<p>This could happen when there are more than 1 contributor/author for the project and they are making changes concurrently over the same period. Example, in a day, both authors tries to commit the same file.</p>
<p>When a conflict happens, it can be due to the following:</p>
<p>i) There are changes to the code in the repository since the last time you updated your local code</p>
<p>ii) Multiple collaborators doing some changes to the same file</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Resolving conflicts</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to resolve the conflict. Typically a window like this might show up. This is for you to decide which version of the code to keep.</p>
<p>There will be times, the Android Studio will just prompt for merge. That&#39;s to merge your changes to the changes another collaborator has done, before you commit your code and after you check out the project.</p>
<p>The idea is to look at the changes and to decide whether to keep your copy, other&#39;s copy or merge the code.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Checking out earlier revisions" duration="5">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Enable the Version Control view in Android Studio. Alt+9 -&gt; Log</li>
</ol>
<p>This displays the list of commits done in the repository.</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>All the commits are shaded light blue. Just select the required commit and checkout will do.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this, it is shown that commit messages are important to give a glimpse of what you have done</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Import a project from Github" duration="5">
        <p>To check out a project from the Github, it&#39;s quite straight forward as the Android Studio has an option for it.</p>
<p>What you need is  the link to the project  on Github as well as where do you want to store the project.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s next?</strong></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>If you are an assigned contributor to the project on Github, you can make changes to the project by committing and pushing new/edited code.</li>
<li>If you are not an assigned contributor, or if you only want to use the Github project as a baseline and turn it into your project (it&#39;s called forking), you could in turn, import the checked-out project into your own repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do that, just follow the guide on Import into Github (Setting up repo)</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Adding additional contributors to a repository" duration="5">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Log in to Github, navigate to the project that you want to allow collaboration with the others.</li>
<li>At the project, click on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab. At the <strong>Collaborators</strong> bar at the navigation bar on the left, you could add collaborators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Collaborators must be a Github registered member and they could be found by inputting their username.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The collaborators would be invited. Upon acceptance, they would be able to make changes to the project.</li>
</ol>
